# HOC Pattern in React
Here withCounter (in withCounter.js file) is an HOC - 

ğŸ‘‰ A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new enhanced component.
ğŸ‘‰ The HOC implements common logic inside it and shares that logic with the wrapped component.
ğŸ‘‰ The original component does not change, but the returned enhanced component has extra functionality.
